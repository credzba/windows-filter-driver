To enable self signed certificates: 
Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON 

Add signcode_cmd to your environment and point it to the sign.cmd file
SIGNCODE_CMD=C:\...\windows-filter-driver\driver\Sign.cmd

For ddkbuild add W7BASE=path to your winddk e.g.
W7BASE=C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1

Make a test cert:
makecert -r -pe -ss PrivateCertStore -n "CN=driver(Test)" driver.cer
signtool sign /v /s PrivateCertStore /n driver(Test) /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll objchk_win7_x86/i386/driver.sys

I tried using certmgr to import the cert and never got it working.. just make your own cert using makecert and sign with it.
